  === SPPP FreeLing interface for the SRG ===

  This directory contains the configuration and data files for SPPP interface
  for the LKB Spanish  Resource Grammar, which allows it to use the low-level
  language processors in FreeLing library.

  Contents of this directory:

   sppp.dat:  File with rules that control the interface behaviour, in order
             to make it meet the needs of your LKB grammar.

              You can:
              - Specify how FreeLing output (form, lemma, PoS) is mapped 
                to SPPP fields (stem, rule_id, form) 
              - List forms for which all analysis are to be retained (i.e.
                ignoring PoS tagger decisions)
              - List forms for which FreeLing output is to be
                changed by another user-specified list of tags.
              - List tag combinations that are to be changed to a single tag

              See the comments in sppp.dat to find out more about
              its possiblities.

   logon.cfg:  Configuration file for FreeLing. You can configure the 
              kind of output (morphological analysys, PoS disambiguation...),
              the linguistic resources used (e.g. form dictionary, multiword 
              lists, enabled/disabled modules, etc.).
               See FreeLing documentation for details on the available options.
  
   data:  Subdirectory containing linguistic data (different than FreeLing defaults)
          which are used in sppp.dat.
