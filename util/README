The scripts in this folder are mainly for the interface with the morphophonological analyzer (Freeling).

The grammar currently relies on Freeling to provide morphophonological tags which are then mapped to "inflectional" rules (found in inflr.tdl). Once the tags are successfully mapped to those rules, the grammar can proceed with trying to find a syntactic analysis for the input.

The tags the grammar currently assumed correspond to Freeling v.4.2.

In order to use ACE, the input format should be the so-called "YY input" (see https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/SrgTop).

Current folder contains scripts which will allow you to update existing [incr tsdb] test suites with a field called i-tokens for each sentence item, which will contain YY-formatted input with Freeling tags. For that, you will need to install Freeling 4.2.

1) Put the test suites in a desired location and make sure you have the Freeling python API (currently included in this repo under freeling/freeling_API) as well as a successful Freeling 4.2 installation (again, see https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/SrgTop). 

2) In the API folder, make sure this line: 

os.environ["FREELINGDIR"] = '/usr' 

...reflects the actual location of the freeling 4.2 installation; this can vary. Sometimes it is /usr/local, sometimes it is something else. 

Once you do (1) and (2), you can run populate_tokens.py as follows:

python3 populate_tokens.py test-suite-to-update-location

Note that this will modify the test suite, so make sure to back it up first. 

The updated test suite can be processed by ACE using e.g. pydelphin wrapper as follows:

delphin process --options="-y --yy-rules" -g ~/delphin/srg/ace/srg.dat --full-forest --select i-tokens path-to-test-suite
